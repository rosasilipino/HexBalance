# HexBalance Programming Language

> HexBalance is a simple, esoteric programming language designed for rule-based logic and structured execution. Programs written in HexBalance consist of two main sections:

**LOGIC**: Defines reusable rules with optional conditions and results.

**FORCE:** Executes commands, evaluates expressions, and applies the defined rules.

## Features
### 1. Rules
Rules are defined in the LOGIC section. Each rule can have:
- A name.
- An optional condition that determines when the rule applies.
- A result that is evaluated if the condition is true.

### 2. Variables
Variables can be initialized using the set keyword in the FORCE section and updated later without it.

### 3. Expressions
Supports mathematical and logical operations such as:
- Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, //, %
- Comparison: ==, >, <
- Logical: and, or, not

### 4. Control Structures
- For Loops: Iterate over a range.
- If Statements: Execute blocks conditionally.

### 5. Printing
Use the ekko keyword to output values or expressions.
